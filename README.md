# AI Paint Wars



This repository includes my code, files and descriptions of my progress for the project, for instructions on how to run them, refer to the project repository created by the class teachers: [LU3IN025-robots](https://github.com/nekonaute/SU-LU3IN025-robots/)

## Description
Two teams of 8 robots ("red team" and "blue team") compete to visit an arena divided into squares. A square belongs to the team that visited it last. Time is limited, and the team with the most squares after 2000 iterations wins. This is a competitive variation on the multi-agent patrol problem, a classic robotics problem.

## Rules
- no communication
- no additional information beyond that provided by sensors
- no construction or use of maps
